  LeoVegas is an online casino and sportbetting provider.
  Being among the biggest in the industry, it was a great challenge and learning experience for me.
  Working on a large scale project with many cross collaborations between teams, has shown me the ins and outs of the industry.
  A few features that I developed and take great pride in are Tournaments, Multiplay (an industry first) and Onsite surveys. This is just a short list of many
  other project that I have been a part off.

  We had an agile way of working, using kanban boards and sprints.
  The stack that I worked with includes React, Node, GraphQL, Git, Jenkins, Kubernetes, GCP and many more.

  Working together with your partner on a project is as much fun as you can get! Especially if your partner is a game
  artist with a great eye for detail and design! Together we built her portfolio, which needed to reflect her artistic skills and still look professional yet playfull.
  SandraDCM.com uses many small animations and little quirks to brighten up the site.

  Lists... we all make lists and every developer creates an app for lists. I couldn't stay behind. I build this initially as a small organiser for my partner and I to
  synchronize our grocery lists together. You can create an account, create lists and share this with other users who can then edit/update the list.
  Todo lists can be done as well! How about a daily task/check off list that resets at midnight? Can all be done in the J&S Organiser.
  Give it a try yourself!

  The stack I use is React, Redux, Node.js for serving the client and REST api's, MongoDB with Mongoose and finally hosting is on Heroku.
  The styling is coming mostly from Semantic UI as I wanted to try UI libraries and the restrictions they bring along.

  My introduction into React, Redux and Firebase came from a great tutorial created by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. After already following his tutorials on Node.js,
  I figured this will surely help me find my way in React. Alongside the course, I build burger-builder, a mock build-your-own-burger-webshop idea. Where you can create an account,
  customize your burger and see the final cost before you place the order.

  This course is one of the reasons for me loving React and being triggered to dive deeper and deeper into React and Javascript. Follow up courses included ES6/ES7,
  the principles of React hooks and hosting webapps on Firebase.

  My brother started his own construction company in the Netherlands and of course I wanted to help out and build his website to help him connect with
  potential customers. The company has closed shop, but the website can still be seen on Heroku.

  To build the site, I used Node.js together with Express to create HTML templates. Some basic HTML, CSS and a bit of jQuery is used to make it all function.

  Watching movies with friends is fun.. if you finally manage to pick one. I build UpNext as one of my first projects to use with friends.
  Everyone can make an account and create a list compiled of your favorite movies. The list of movies is coming from OMDB, the free movie database api. You can
  create your own named lists and share those with friends. So before you come over to watch a movie, you can see what everyone decided beforehand!

  I make heavy use of Jquery in this project, especially since I was using a lot of different forms.
  The backend is build with Node.js, Express and is connected to MongoDB with Mongoose.
