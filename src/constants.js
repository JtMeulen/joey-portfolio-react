  My main focus while working here has been on improving and adding new features to the internal tools and associated control systems.
  The project was build with React while using Styled Components to build a nice UI library which was powered by Storybook.

  A few features I developed and take great pride in are Tournaments, Onsite surveys and Multiplay (an industry first). These are just a few examples;
  working on such a large scale project, cross collaborating between many teams, has shown me all corners of web development.

  We had an agile way of working, using Kanban boards and sprints.
  The stack I worked with included React, Node, GraphQL, Git, Jenkins, Kubernetes, GCP - and many more.

  SandraDCM.com uses many little quirks to achieve her preferred playful style, like an animating parallax header and sliding elements.

  Alright, so every developer creates an app for lists... and I couldn't stay behind! I initially built this webapp as a small checklist for my partner and I to
  synchronize our grocery lists together.

  description2:
  `
  With this organiser you can create accounts and lists, which can be shared with other users - who can then edit/update the lists.
  How about a daily task/check off list that resets at midnight? Try it with the J&S Organiser!

  I used React, Redux and Node.js for serving the client and REST api's, MongoDB with Mongoose and hosted it on Heroku.
  The styling comes mostly from Semantic UI, as I wanted to try UI libraries and the restrictions they bring along.

  My introduction into React, Redux and Firebase came from a great tutorial created by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. After following his tutorials on Node.js,
  this project further helped me find my way in React.
  `,

  `
  The tutorial helped me build Burger Builder, a mock build-your-own-burger-webshop idea. You can create an account,
  customize your burger and see the final cost before placing your order.

  `
  Doing this project motivated me to dive deeper and deeper into React and Javascript. Follow-up courses included ES6/ES7,
  the principles of React hooks and hosting webapps on Firebase.

  My brother started his own construction company in our home country, the Netherlands - so naturally, I built his website to help him connect with
  potential customers. The company has closed shop by now, but the website can still be seen on Heroku.

  I used Node.js together with Express to create HTML templates. Basic HTML, CSS and a bit of jQuery was used to make it all function. This was originally hosted
  on DigitalOcean.

  Watching movies with friends is always fun - if you can agree on what to watch! UpNext was one of my first projects to use with friends.
  Everyone can create personalized lists of their favorite or yet-to-see movies and share those with friends. The movies come from OMDB, the free movie database api.

  This project makes heavy use of jQuery, especially because it needed a lot of different forms and asynchronous queries.
  The backend is build with Node.js and Express and is connected to MongoDB with Mongoose.
