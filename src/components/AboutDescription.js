        Hello! I am Joey, a {getYearsSince("1989-02-16")}-year-old frontend web
        developer from Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
        <br />
        <br />
        After having coded at home as a hobby for a while, I officially joined
        the development industry at the start of 2018. I have since been
        developing websites professionally, focusing on ReactJs, Node.js and
        GraphQlâ€‹.
        <br />
        <br />
        With over {getYearsSince("2018-01-01")} years of working experience, my
        main focus has shifted towards developing design systems using web
        components. React.js continues to be a significant part of my work.
